1. DON'T REMOVE ANY FILE FROM THIS DIRECTORY

  --because these are original files and don't have backup 


2. DON'T RENAME ANY FILE OF THIS DIRECTORY

  --because some python files are imported,and some file names are used in the python program..so renaming may cause errors in the program and setup 
  
3. These all files are inter-dependent, so rather than moving one file move the parent folder

4. The file 'd' is shortcut of file 'Distributor.py', both are same

5. Dont't Modify the file 'Distributor.py' only modify its database file i.e 'Distributor_database.py'
